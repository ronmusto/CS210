# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
This project is designed to calculate and report the frequency of item purchases in a grocery store on any given day. The user interface is coded in C++ and Python is calculating the frequency. The code can pull up the full list of items purchased that day and their frequency as both a number or histogram and it can also report the quantity of a single searched item. 

# What did you do particularly well?
I think that the actual functionality of the code is my strongest point here, the code functions as intended and produces the correct results. There is also effective error handling to ensure that the user can't cause the program to crash or enter a nonsensical input. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think that the user interface could definitely be more attractive and friendly. Right now it is all just greentext on a black screen so I think adding some color and decoration could improve the program quite a bit. I think this would make the code much more usable to the average person and also more marketable because people will actually want to use it. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I think the most challenging code to write was the actual integration aspect between Python and C++. It was very difficult to get the two languages to pass information back and forth properly. The tutors also were not very helpful in this. How I got around it was honestly just a lot of experimentation. I toyed around with the code for a very long time and eventually it started to make sense to me as I experimented around with it.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think the knowledge of how to integrate Python and C++ will be extremely useful in the future as I can see how the benefits of using multiple languages can really come in handy. Sometimes you want the powerful formatting capabilities of C++ but also need the expansive mathematical libraries in Python in the same program. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I strived to produce this code in as few lines as possible in order to keep it readable and maintainable. I also added numerous comments to explain the code at every step so it is clear what does what. I also utilized functions so that my code can be easily copied over to other programs and used there.

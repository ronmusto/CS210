# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
This project is designed to calculate and report the frequency of item purchases in a grocery store on any given day. The user interface is coded in C++ and Python is calculating the frequency. The code can pull up the full list of items purchased that day and their frequency as both a number or histogram and it can also report the quantity of a single searched item. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think the knowledge of how to integrate Python and C++ will be extremely useful in the future as I can see how the benefits of using multiple languages can really come in handy. Sometimes you want the powerful formatting capabilities of C++ but also need the expansive mathematical libraries in Python in the same program. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I strived to produce this code in as few lines as possible in order to keep it readable and maintainable. I also added numerous comments to explain the code at every step so it is clear what does what. I also utilized functions so that my code can be easily copied over to other programs and used there.
